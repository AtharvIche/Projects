REAL TIME OBJECT DETECTION FROM VIDEO INPUT
This project demonstrates the use of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify objects in a video. The provided code processes a video file, detects animals and objects in the frames, and displays them with bounding boxes and labels.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
YOLO pre-trained model files:
yolov3.weights
yolov3.cfg
COCO dataset label file: coco.names
A video file (input.mp4) for testing
